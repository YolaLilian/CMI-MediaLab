Setting up an onepager for the CMILab 2020-2021 project EMI op Zuid. 

### Important!

For getting this page to work in development mode:

* Direct your terminal to the root of this project if you aren't there already.
* Run `npm install`.
* When finished, run `npm start`. This will make sure your updates get compiled when you save your file.
  
* To edit the css, edit the file in /_sass called `main.scss`.

Happy developing!
